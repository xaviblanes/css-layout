    <h2>Radiation from Elon Musk's Starlink satellites is 'blinding' scientists from seeing the universe</h2>
    <h5>Title description, Dec 7, 2024</h5>

<p> As the number of satellites around the Earth increases, so does the risk of radio interference, a rising concern for researchers, according to a new study.</p><p>

Satellites from the company Starlink are "potentially blinding radio telescopes" with the waves they are emitting, according to Dutch scientists. </p><p>

Researchers from the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON) conducted two observation sessions using the LOFAR (Low Frequency Array) radio telescope, the largest on Earth. </p><p>

Equipped with a specialised antenna and receiver, radio telescopes detect and study radio waves emitted by various objects in space, such as stars, galaxies, and nebulae.</p><p>

<p>However, scientific observations could be jeopardised by the electromagnetic radiation coming from the growing number of satellites, according to a new study published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.</p>

<h2>We don't know exactly what went wrong</h2>
<h5>Title description, Sep 2, 2024</h5>
<div class="fakeimg"><img src="images/spacex.jpg" width=100%></div>
<p> SpaceX did not share what, exactly, the issues were that led engineers to wave off today’s launch attempt.</p><p>

One noteworthy point: The company only stacked the Starship spacecraft atop the Super Heavy booster this morning. Such last-minute assembly is not common in the world of rocketry.</p><p>

SpaceX’s Dan Huot said the company opted to wait to stack the rocket system in an effort to continue chasing the goal of making Starship as nimble as possible.</p><p>

“We really want to get to a point where we can fly rapidly, fly as quickly as possible,” Huot said. “And so this is definitely a case to try and push that forward.”</p><p>

He added that SpaceX did not conduct a “wet dress” rehearsal of the vehicle, a ground test that typically precedes rocket launches during which engineers fill the rocket with fuel and practice for launch. Such proceedings are typically opportunities to hash out any issues before launch. </p>
